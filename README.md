# cli-task-manager

This is a simple command-line task manager built in Python.
Tasks are saved locally in a JSON file so they persist between sessions.

## Features
- Add tasks
- View all tasks with their status
- Mark tasks as complete
- Clear all tasks

## How to Run
git clone https://github.com/coldstack/cli-task-manager.git
cd cli-task-manager
python main.py

## Usage
When the program starts, type one of the following commands:

| Command  | Description          |
|----------|----------------------|
| add      | Add a new task       |
| list     | List all tasks       |
| complete | Mark a task as done  |
| clearall | Delete all tasks     |
| quit     | Exit the program     |

## What I learned
This was my first ever proper project. I learned file I/O, JSON parsing, functions and CLI structure in Python.
